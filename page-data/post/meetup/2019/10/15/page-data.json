In order to maintain developer velocity and quality, we‚Äôre in the process of dramatically shifting how we build web applications. Historically, we‚Äôve built large monolith applications that have upwards of a hundred contributors, but we‚Äôve found that this approach has limited our ability to iterate, and innovate as quickly as we‚Äôd like.</p>\n<p>Today, we‚Äôre focusing on splitting our monolith applications into smaller, more manageable components. In this talk, I‚Äôll cover in detail how we developed a platform that enables building decoupled, distributed systems that perform and feel like a single application.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôve developed a platform that enables the independent deployability of units of user interface units across products and pages. In this talk I‚Äôll describe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The types of problems a decoupled, and distributed frontend solve</li>\n<li>The individual subsystems of the platform and how those systems fit together</li>\n<li>How we built, and monitor the system, especially as it grows</li>\n<li>The tradeoffs, and problems we‚Äôve run into, and how we‚Äôve solved them thus far</li>\n<li>How to practically, and incrementally adopt this kind of system in your ecosystem</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"date":"October 15, 2019","dateShort":"2019-10-15","postTypes":["meetup"],"slug":"/post/meetup/2019/10/15/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mosaic: a Platform for Micro-Frontends at Indeed","speakers":[{"name":"Ben Cripps","title":"Full Stack Software Engineer at Indeed","bio":"<p>Born in Washington D.C., Ben now lives in Austin, Texas via Baltimore MD.
